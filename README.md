## Introduction

This project is a classic Tic Tac Toe game where two players can play against each other. The game board is a 3x3 grid, and players take turns to mark a cell with their symbol (X or O). The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game. If all cells are filled without any player winning, the game is declared a draw.
